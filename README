Requirements
============

* Ganglia 3.x (assumed that default directories are used: e.g., /var/lib/ganglia/rrds)

* rrdtool (1.2 or higher preferred)

* gnuplot (4.0 or higher preferred)

* apache 1.x or 2.x

* php 5.x (with mysql support)

* [optional] arial.ttf font (typically installed in /usr/share/fonts/truetype)

    Example: sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts && cd /usr/share/fonts/truetype; ln -s msttcorefonts/arial.ttf


Installation
============

It is assumed that you already have a working Ganglia setup.

1) Install any missing required packages (see Requirements section above).

2) Copy capacity directory to it's permanent home (e.g., /usr/local/capacity).

3) Create mysql database:

    mysql -u root -p < /usr/local/capacity/capacity_db.sql

4) Modify cluster.inc and grab_rrd_data.inc in conf directory to your liking.  The contents of cluster.inc are
   closely tied to your Ganglia directory structure.  Note: the web interface allows you to edit these files 
   as well.

5) Setup apache to serve the php scripts under the html directory. TODO: include sample apache conf.d file.

6) Test grab_rrd_data.php (which collects ganglia data into db) in the bin directory:

    php /usr/local/capacity/bin/grab_rrd_data.php

7) If no errors reported in step 6, install cron job:

    cp /usr/local/capacity/capacity.cron /etc/cron.d/ && /etc/init.d/cron reload

    - OR -

    [edit capacity.cron to your liking, removing the root username]
    crontab /usr/local/capacity.cron

8) Once there's data collected, visit the web interface you set up with apache.  You can click on any peak metric
   to see a graph of that metric over time.  Note: trend graphs will obviously only become useful after several 
   days/weeks/months of data is collected. :)

That should be it.
